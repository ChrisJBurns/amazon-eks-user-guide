# Using a supported AWS SDK<a name="iam-roles-for-service-accounts-minimum-sdk"></a>

The containers in your pods must use an AWS SDK version that supports assuming an IAM role through an OpenID Connect web identity token file\. AWS SDKs that are included in Linux distribution package managers might not be new enough to support this feature\. Be sure to use the following versions, or later, for your SDK:
+ Java \(Version 2\) – [2\.10\.11](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/releases/tag/2.10.11)
+ Java – [1\.11\.704](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/releases/tag/1.11.704)
+ Go – [1\.23\.13](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.23.13)
+ Python \(Boto3\) – [1\.9\.220](https://github.com/boto/boto3/releases/tag/1.9.220)
+ Python \(botocore\) – [1\.12\.200](https://github.com/boto/botocore/releases/tag/1.12.200)
+ AWS CLI – [1\.16\.232](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/releases/tag/1.16.232)
+ Node
  + [2\.525\.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/releases/tag/v2.525.0)
  + [3\.27\.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/releases/tag/v3.27.0)
+ Ruby – [3\.58\.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/version-3/gems/aws-sdk-core/CHANGELOG.md#3580-2019-07-01)
+ C\+\+ – [1\.7\.174](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/releases/tag/1.7.174)
+ \.NET – [3\.3\.659\.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/releases/tag/3.3.659.1)
  + You must also include `AWSSDK.SecurityToken` to make use of IRSA in EKS.
+ PHP – [3\.110\.7](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/releases/tag/3.110.7)

Many popular Kubernetes add\-ons, such as the [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) and the [Installing the AWS Load Balancer Controller add\-on](aws-load-balancer-controller.md), support IAM roles for service accounts\. The [https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) also supports IAM roles for service accounts\.

To ensure that you're using a supported SDK, follow the installation instructions for your preferred SDK at [Tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) when you build your containers\.
